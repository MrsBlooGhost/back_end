# **Definition**

Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm created as a solution to the growing complexity of large programs. It allows the programmer to write concise code that is easy to maintain.

The Ruby core library contains classes from which objects are instantiated from. The magic of OOP is the ability to create custom class from which custom objects can be instantiated from. This allows the programmer to extend functionality past the Ruby core library.

# **Implementation**

The main pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

# **Examples**

```ruby
