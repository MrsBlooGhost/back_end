Interface inheritance is demonstrated here. Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, but it does support interface inheritance, which gives a class access to behavior defined in one or more modules. One or more related methods may be defined in a module, which is then made available to a class via the keyword "include". These modules are called "mixin modules". Typically, interface inheritance is chosen over class inheritance when a class's relationship with the behavior defined is a "has-a" relationship rather than an "is-a" relationship. In this case, both teachers and students "have-an" ability to greet.
